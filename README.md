# EmailsFromGoogleUrls
Python Scraper that Gets Emails from URLs found in Google Search Queries


What will you use this for? First thing you want to check is your **local legislation. **

How to use?

Make sure you have all the modules imported

First, create a list of things you want to search. If you wanted to look up racetracks for example you might have a csv that looks like: 
  daytona, sonoma raceway, Circuit du Monaco, ...
  add any search operators youd like to the query variables, for example -nascar would remove results containing nascar in the text
  
Second, create a list of urls you dont want. You can include TLDs that are irrelevant. For example, .it, .ca, etc.

Third, choose where you want to write the files to. A simple naming convention is recommended.


Let me know if you have any suggestions for improvements or otherwise. Thank you for checking it out!
